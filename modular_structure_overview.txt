BuddyWay Modular Structure Overview
===================================

I've reorganized the codebase into a modular structure that separates concerns while maintaining all existing functionality. Here's an explanation of each file and its purpose:

1. app.js
---------
The main application entry point that initializes the Express server, Socket.IO, and connects all the modules together. It's now much cleaner and easier to understand at a glance.

2. config/socketConfig.js
------------------------
Contains the Socket.IO configuration settings, including CORS options and connection parameters. This isolates all Socket.IO specific configuration in one place.

3. models/sessionManager.js
--------------------------
A comprehensive session management module that handles:
- Session creation, joining, and ending
- Location tracking and updates
- Route management
- Common destination functionality
- Session persistence (saving/loading from file)
- User disconnection handling
- Session cleanup

This is the core data management layer of the application.

4. socket/events.js
------------------
Sets up all Socket.IO event listeners and connects them to the appropriate handlers. It also initializes the cleanup interval for expired sessions.

5. socket/handlers.js
--------------------
Contains all the handler functions for Socket.IO events. Each handler is responsible for:
- Processing incoming socket events
- Interacting with the sessionManager
- Emitting appropriate responses
- Broadcasting updates to other users

6. routes/index.js
-----------------
Manages all Express routes for the application, currently handling the home page and map page routes.

7. utils/helpers.js
-----------------
Contains utility functions that can be used across the application, such as the session code generator.

Benefits of This Structure:
--------------------------
1. Separation of concerns - Each module has a specific responsibility
2. Improved maintainability - Easier to find and fix issues
3. Better scalability - New features can be added without cluttering the main file
4. Enhanced readability - Code is organized logically by function
5. Easier testing - Modules can be tested independently

How to Add New Features:
-----------------------
1. For new socket events: Add handlers in socket/handlers.js and register them in socket/events.js
2. For new data management: Extend the sessionManager in models/sessionManager.js
3. For new pages: Add routes in routes/index.js
4. For new utility functions: Add them to utils/helpers.js

This modular structure provides a solid foundation for adding new features like chat functionality or voice groups without creating a tangled codebase.
